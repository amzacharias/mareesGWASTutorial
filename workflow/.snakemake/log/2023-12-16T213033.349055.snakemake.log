MissingOutputException in rule stringentMissingFilter in file /global/home/hpc4920/mareesTutorialGWAS/workflow/Snakefile, line 102:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/1_qcGWAS/1_missing/HapMap_3_r3_snp002.bed
results/1_qcGWAS/1_missing/HapMap_3_r3_snp002.bim
