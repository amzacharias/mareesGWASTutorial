MissingOutputException in rule sexCheck in file /global/home/hpc4920/mareesTutorialGWAS/workflow/Snakefile, line 33:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/1_qcGWAS/2_sexCheck/plink.sexcheck
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
