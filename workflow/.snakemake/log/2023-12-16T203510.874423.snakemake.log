MissingOutputException in rule runMissingness in file /global/home/hpc4920/mareesTutorialGWAS/workflow/Snakefile, line 27:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/1_qcGWAS/1_missing/plink.imiss
results/1_qcGWAS/1_missing/plink.lmiss
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
